Lottery Results Analysis (1724 - Present)
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of lottery results spanning from 1724 to the present day, leveraging SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) and SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) for streamlined data integration and insightful reporting.

Objectives
Data Integration: Use SSIS to extract, transform, and load (ETL) historical lottery data from various sources into a centralized SQL Server database.
Data Analysis and Reporting: Implement SSRS to generate dynamic reports and dashboards that provide valuable insights, statistical trends, and detailed analyses of historical lottery data.
Technologies Used
SSIS (SQL Server Integration Services): For building and automating ETL workflows.
SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services): For generating reports and dashboards to visualize trends and patterns.
SQL Server Database: As the primary data storage solution for processing and analysis of the extensive lottery dataset.
Project Workflow
1. Data Collection and Preparation
Data Sources: Collect lottery result data from credible, historical sources.
Data Cleaning & Transformation: Standardize, clean, and prepare data in a compatible format for SQL Server ingestion.
2. ETL Pipeline Design (SSIS)
Extraction: Build SSIS packages to import raw data into SQL Server.
Transformation: Implement transformation processes to clean and format data.
Loading: Load transformed data into a centralized database, ready for analysis.
3. Data Analysis and Aggregation
Statistical Analysis: Use SQL queries to uncover patterns and historical trends in lottery results.
Aggregation: Develop summary tables and aggregate data for high-level insights and drill-down capabilities.
4. Report and Dashboard Development (SSRS)
Report Building: Design reports in SSRS to present historical trends and statistical summaries.
Dashboard Creation: Create an interactive dashboard to allow users to explore data through visualizations and gain deeper insights.
